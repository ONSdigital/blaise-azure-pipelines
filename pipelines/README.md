# Configure Blaise

Installs Blaise, installs database connector, opens ports on the VMs, sets up Blaise, and sets up the databases Blaise will use.

Note that the databases won't be setup again if their Blaise data interface file already exist on the management VM. This is because running the setup again will wipe any data on the database!
